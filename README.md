# OpenSunshine Data and Methods

This repo contains the raw data and corresponding methodology behind the [OpenSunshine project](). It is meant to illustrate how I processed the data for publication. The `data` directory and `Methodology.ipynb` provides a step-by-step reproducible methodology to transform the source files from the government into the final dataset used on the project page. 

If you want to search through and download the data, or any section thereof, the website is a better venue.
